# Synacore
the Synacore Challenge (https://challenge.synacor.com/)  
  
I decided to take this up at the recommendation of a friend.  

# Current version
Implemented opcodes.  Have not tested it yet.

# Lanuage
C# once again, with a little bit of SFML 2.5 because I can't do things the easy way.

# Specs
 * 22 instructions (0-22)  
 * All int based instructions and arguments  
 * All math is %32768  
 * Single threaded  
 * expected to load 1 rom, that is included with the challenge (see the link and sign up to get it)
 * instructions can take from 0 to 3 args
 * includes a NOP and a HALT instruction
